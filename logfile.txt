[09:44:54] <robbiet480> morning
[09:50:52] <ChrisCook> How did the MakeSF talk go?
[09:59:04] <robbiet480> ChrisCook: very well
[10:01:59] <ChrisCook> ..and..?
[10:02:18] <davr> how many ppl were there? and how many you think will come to us?
[10:02:43] <ChrisCook> davr: Ha! Saw you last night at TechShop
[10:03:23] <davr> ChrisCook: i don't know what they are thinking, but now i am approved to use the tormach cnc to mill objects out of solid metal
[10:04:12] <ChrisCook> davr: likewise I am now gifted with the abillity to cut solid objectsâ€¦ WITH LIGHT!
[10:05:05] * davr just placed an order for a block of aluminum and a couple sheets of acrylic
[10:05:06] <antifuchs> whereas we regular folk are only able to cut light with solid objects.
[10:05:10] <antifuchs> (or refract, sometimes)
[10:05:12] <robbiet480> ChrisCook: davr 30 or so, a bunch
[10:08:50] <ChrisCook> davr: you find a good price on the acrylic?
[10:11:24] <robbiet480> ChrisCook: can i come over at like 1130 and take you to lunch at bakesale betty
[10:11:27] <robbiet480> :p
[10:12:19] <ChrisCook> robbiet480: Hah.. sure.
[10:12:27] <robbiet480> jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
[10:12:34] <robbiet480> antifuchs: you can also join us for lunch!
[10:12:42] <antifuchs> ooooh
[10:12:44] <antifuchs> yay
[10:12:52] <robbiet480> or i guess pandora tiem
[10:12:55] <robbiet480> if ChrisCook is ok with that
[10:13:06] <robbiet480> i just want to run up and grab swag and run!
[10:13:07] <ChrisCook> fine by me
[10:13:29] <robbiet480> (antifuchs: he works at pandora, im going to grab swag, its one block from you and me)
[10:13:53] <antifuchs> whee
[10:14:21] <robbiet480> ChrisCook: gief me number so i can textually message you later
[10:14:57] <ChrisCook> 5104992813
[10:15:08] <robbiet480> excellent
[10:15:13] <davr> ChrisCook: i just bought a couple 12"x12" sheets from onlinemetals.com, since i was already buying aluminum from them, and it didn't cost too much ($2.50 to $10 or so depending on thickness)
[10:15:18] <robbiet480> antifuchs: meet at my place at 1125, walk over, then lunching?
[10:15:23] <davr> metal itself is expensive though
[10:15:28] <antifuchs> sounds good

[13:18:34] <JMunakra> i dropped him a mail asking about price
[13:27:18] <romanian_SNA> cool
[14:23:10] <drgone> hi albillings 
[14:23:22] <albillings> drgone: hi
[14:23:36] <drgone> so your molds from the other night turned out worse.
[14:23:40] <drgone> i made an error in judgement
[14:23:48] <drgone> figured debubbling before pouring would help
[14:23:50] <drgone> it didnt
[14:23:58] <albillings> ack
[14:24:01] <drgone> yse
[14:24:17] <drgone> so i've got aimee doing a repour
[14:24:23] <albillings> Okey dokey
[14:24:30] <albillings> I'm not terribly concerned about timing
[14:24:35] <albillings> I just wanted to check on things
[14:24:50] <drgone> yeah
[14:25:12] <drgone> this whole endeavor has been a learning experience
[14:25:15] <albillings> :-)
[14:25:17] <albillings> I bet
[14:25:35] <drgone> it is a good thing
[14:25:44] <drgone> but it eats up huge chunks of time and brain
[14:25:59] <albillings> Have many people gotten mold sets?
[14:26:45] <drgone> not a lot
[14:26:49] <drgone> mostly people get parts
[14:27:09] <drgone> i actually thought more people would get molds for their hackerspaces
[14:27:16] <albillings> Yeah, I would think so
[14:27:20] <drgone> there's a big opportunity there for workshops and stuff
[14:27:22] <albillings> we plan on making a few repraps
[14:27:30] <albillings> and give away printed parts
[14:27:42] <albillings> of course, we have, between us, four or five cupcakes
[14:27:48] <albillings> (now orphaned)
[14:28:39] <albillings> I'm hoping to build a bit of a support community for cupcake owners on openfab.me as well.
[14:46:40] <drgone> yeah. we have a few cupcakes too
[14:46:51] <drgone> been upgrading them to have wade extruders
[14:47:00] <drgone> since the mk3/mk4 ones kind of suck.
[14:47:11] jenk_ is now known as wooster
[14:48:07] <albillings> drgone: I have a mk6 extruder
[14:48:20] <albillings> I just bought a new makergear hybrid for the upcoming reprap
[14:48:31] <drgone> cool
[14:48:38] <albillings> 1.75mm plastic, ABS or PLA, .5, .4, .25 nozzles
[14:48:49] <albillings> trying to find a f'ing RAMPS board is an act of God though
[14:48:54] <davr> makerbot is doing bigger nozzles now
[14:49:06] <albillings> I'm not buying more makerbot stuff
[14:49:10] <davr> what's a RAMPS board?
[14:49:11] <albillings> they burned the cupcake community

[14:50:22] <albillings> that said, drgone, if they have smaller nozzles for the mk6, I may get one since I already have the new plastruder there
[14:51:39] <drgone> i think we're going to start making our own nozzle/hot end
[14:51:52] <drgone> we've already done nozzles to .35mm
[14:52:04] <drgone> and getting away from nichrome is key
[14:54:04] <drgone> i'm not sure if they actually *burned* the cupcake community
[14:54:12] <drgone> they just stopped making it
[14:54:53] <davr> albillings: have you looked at these guys? http://www.reprapstores.com/catalog/electronics
[14:54:55] <ToyBot> [Link Info] title: Electronics | RepRap Stores
[14:55:04] <albillings> yep
[14:55:17] <albillings> do you see RAMPS there, davr? :-)
[14:55:29] <davr> are you 100% set on using RAMPS?
[14:55:47] <albillings> yes
[14:55:54] <davr> these guys basically made their own version
[14:56:02] <albillings> Already have ALL of the components for electronics except the assembled RAMPS board
[14:56:13] <davr> doh
[14:56:38] <albillings> ultimaker will have them again in a few days
[14:56:43] <drgone> oh. that's a techzone right?
[14:56:50] <drgone> techzone is kind of funky
[14:56:56] <drgone> floating ground issues
[14:57:11] <antifuchs> drgone: whenever somebody changes their product dev cycle, there's hyperbole (:
[14:57:31] <drgone> well
[14:57:35] <drgone> we have exp. with it
[14:57:47] <drgone> the UW got some of their boards when they came out
[14:57:56] <drgone> so did a couple other locals
[14:58:05] <drgone> they were problematic
[14:58:43] <drgone> possible it was just that first run, but they were fairly sketch
[15:00:18] <albillings> I had to get reprap parts from something like five providers (not counting my megaduino and the upcoming RAMPS purchase).
[15:02:44] <drgone> yeah. it is pretty ridiculous, but it is an involved project.
[15:02:53] <drgone> and nobody believes in making money
[15:03:00] <drgone> so nobody can actually have everything
[15:04:47] <antifuchs> everybody believes in money, but nobody wants to go the makerbot route of making a company and doing hard work for what is essentially a hobbyist machine at the moment (:
[15:04:47] <ToyBot> yay makerbots
[15:05:09] <antifuchs> and sourcing that shit is hard work
[15:06:11] <drgone> i dunno. i have been hanging out with reprap people for a while, and although everyone wants to make kits, none of them want to charge more than it costs to make them.
[15:06:40] <drgone> selling printed parts at $100 for example
[15:06:50] <antifuchs> yeah. valuing your time at 0 is a great way to run out of money quickly (:
[15:06:53] <davr> people that want to make money selling reprap kits == makerbot
[15:07:02] <drgone> right.
[15:07:04] <antifuchs> davr: tbf, there are others
[15:07:12] <drgone> and everyone hates them because they made 3d printing popular.
[15:07:16] <antifuchs> makerbot sell repstrap kits, too (:
[15:07:34] <davr> those techzone guys have a full kit
[15:07:39] <antifuchs> drgone: but nobody wants to one-up them ((:
[15:07:50] <antifuchs> davr: also, some reprap distributors in the uk
[15:07:51] <davr> ultimaker has a full kit
[15:07:59] <drgone> ultimaker isn't shipping yet
[15:08:01] <antifuchs> but they don't really take off
[15:08:06] <antifuchs> drgone: tehy're taking orders (:
[15:08:10] <drgone> oh OK
[15:08:21] <davr> expensive though
[15:08:32] <davr> but if it really does as they claim, probably worth it
[15:08:36] <drgone> i figure with clonedel, we can knock the price down hard
[15:08:46] <antifuchs> it's what happens when you have people spend lots of time on a project that will maybe benefit a few thousand customers (:
[15:08:48] <drgone> and actually knock production time down
[15:09:31] <drgone> but that pissed off a lot of people
[15:09:36] * drgone shrugs
[15:09:48] <antifuchs> drgone: let the neckbeards fight (:
[15:09:52] <drgone> indeed.
[15:10:06] <davr> there are actually people complaining about clonedel making it too easy/cheap?
[15:11:00] <antifuchs> I guess not having printed parts in there is a bad thing
[15:11:37] <antifuchs> says you don't believe in the cause!
[15:11:48] <antifuchs> counter-revolutionary! (:
[15:12:00] <albillings> drgone: The ultimaker guys started taking orders this week
[15:12:18] <albillings> I thought about starting a reprap kits company but then Ella told me that you were working on eating that lunch.
[15:12:36] <drgone> i'm actually not going for the kit lunch
[15:12:56] <albillings> Well, we did have people saying that we shouldn't buy clonedel molds because they were "too expensive" and we should just "make our own."
[15:12:59] <albillings> which we then didn't do
[15:13:08] <albillings> so I said "Fuck it" and bought the molds personally
[15:13:10] <drgone> i'm going for the electronics and parts
[15:13:22] <drgone> because the parts thing is stupid
[15:13:26] <drgone> and electronics are always out of stock
[15:13:28] <albillings> Well, cliff, who is often here, has prototypes of his new boards coming in a few weeks
[15:13:41] <albillings> merges RAMPS and Arduino stuff (plus other, I think) with RAM onto one board
[15:13:43] <drgone> nice. are they actually different than the regular boards?
[15:13:52] <drgone> cool.
[15:13:55] <albillings> if you e-mail me, I'll hook you up
[15:14:03] <albillings> he's often here or I'd say talk to him here. :-)
[15:14:06] <drgone> we are changing some things as well.
[15:14:13] <albillings> I've seen sketches of the designs but I'm not an EE
[15:14:18] <albillings> so it was like "ooookaaaaay"
[15:14:29] <drgone> because our goal is not to have the pimpest robot
[15:14:31] <drgone> just a functional one.
[15:14:38] <drgone> and 'always be in stock'
[15:14:46] <antifuchs> hahaha
[15:14:50] <antifuchs> coffee is for stockers only!
[15:14:56] <drgone> srsly
[15:15:02] <albillings> I'm just pissed that I paid shipping five times
[15:15:11] <albillings> including one thing going through customs
[15:15:15] <drgone> the molds you got were super cheap
[15:15:16] <drgone> btw
[15:15:26] <albillings> I know
[15:15:35] <albillings> I priced out others making them
[15:15:36] <drgone> i came up with that price before i realized how much of a pain in the ass it would be
[15:15:53] <drgone> but i gave myself a month for an out
[15:15:54] <albillings> I have theoretical access to a 3d printer of commercial quality here but the operator is a complete flake
[15:15:57] <albillings> yeah
[15:16:06] <albillings> that's why I ordered two days before the end of the month
[15:16:10] <drgone> i also knew a bunch of people that should bite wouldnt
[15:16:31] <drgone> yeah. commercial printing is pricey
[15:16:49] <drgone> metrix has ridiculously low prices because we are bringing people who have never done any of this to the table.
[15:17:13] <drgone> we charge less for laser than ponoko. and we do it until midnight.
[15:17:21] <albillings> I had free access to one but see flake factor
[15:17:44] <drgone> yeah. 
[15:17:53] <drgone> this is why i hire people at metrix
[15:18:13] <drgone> avoids broken laser, keeps doors open regular hours.
[15:18:55] <drgone> no drama hackerspace, community is oblivious to actual space issues.
[15:19:23] <drgone> which means that people can be casual members
[15:20:34] <albillings_> drgone: if you replied, the shitty net here just ate it
[15:20:50] <albillings_> I'm surrounded by 380+ coworkers who just borked the net

[15:27:17] <davr> whatever people want basically...I don't think I have enough people interested in the same thing, with the same hardware, learning at the same speed, such that I can stand up and lecture as people follow along
[15:27:44] <ChrisCook> much turnout?
[15:27:56] <davr> I can help with building, setting up, programming, etc. I have some kits if you want to put one together, or if you already have an arduino i have random parts I can show you how to use with it
[15:28:15] <davr> i've only had 2 so far, it was like 8 people the first time and 5 people the second i think?
[15:28:21] <davr> decent I guess
[15:33:52] <robbiet480> albillings: davr its like 75 bucks for the day
[15:34:02] <albillings> ah
[15:34:27] <davr> robbiet480: i paid $100 to jump out of a plane, but that's only once
[16:03:08] <SeanIAm> sean smells

[16:45:14] <davr> isn't that like two blocks from us
[16:45:29] <davr> also let me know if you post us to reddit so i can upboat it
[16:47:33] <robbiet480> yes
[16:47:35] <robbiet480> i just did

[16:49:03] <robbiet480> also will post to r/oakland
[16:50:40] <wooster> do you guys ever go to al lasher's?
[16:50:45] <wooster> does that even still exist
[16:51:03] <robbiet480> no idea
[16:51:55] <wooster> where should i get electronic parts
[16:51:58] <wooster> i need a midi jack
[16:52:20] <davr> i went there once
[16:52:50] <davr> basically if you need something TODAY and you don't want to get raped quite as hard as radio shack
[16:52:55] <davr> otherwise online is the way to go
[16:53:53] <wooster> where's good online?
[16:54:34] <davr> digikey.com for most stuff, but some things they have are overpriced and mouser.com or newark.com is cheaper
[16:54:52] <wooster> thanks
[16:54:54] <davr> occasionally i'll search for the part on ebay, if you don't mind waiting two or three weeks you can get them super cheap from china
[16:55:18] <davr> oh also there's jameco.com which is in south sf so ships pretty quick
[16:55:51] <davr> then there's the "surplus" type stores that don't have good selection, but sometimes can be super cheap. allelectronics.com and goldmine-elec.com

[17:02:33] <robbiet480> hey
[17:02:35] <robbiet480> guise
[17:02:38] <robbiet480> go check out my new project
[17:02:41] <robbiet480> firstworldproblems.me
[17:02:42] <wooster> what do i need to do to run my noobie without plugging it into usb? do i just put 3v into some pins?
[17:02:57] <wooster> ha
[17:03:13] <robbiet480> please retweet
[17:03:16] <robbiet480> send to as many people as possible
[17:28:13] <robbiet480> upvote: http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/gphzi/hi_rfirstworldproblems_i_made_this_for_you/
[17:28:14] <ToyBot> [Link Info] title: Hi /r/firstworldproblems. I made this for you. : firstworldproblems
[17:33:52] <wooster> i have a 0.5watt phase lock loop FM transmitter i'd be happy to leave at the space, if anyone is interested in playing with it
[17:33:56] <wooster> it needs a new amp
[17:33:59] <wooster> not sure about the filter
[17:34:18] <davr> wooster: for like $1-3 you can get a "USB charger", one end plugs into the wall, the other end has a usb socket, just provides 5V power
[17:34:38] <wooster> so i need to power it over usb?
[17:36:45] <davr> that's the easiest way, but if you have some other regulated 5V or 3.3V source, you can connect it directly to the 5V or 3.3V pins (along with Ground)
[17:37:29] <wooster> like, two AA batteries?
[17:40:10] <davr> That should work, AVR is pretty tolerant about voltage range
[17:40:17] <davr> but if you have any other IC's they might be more strict
[17:40:55] <davr> 2 AAs will range from 3.2V down to about 2.6V or less as they run down
[17:43:02] <wooster> ok
[20:32:29] <davr> robbiet480: when are you gonna make your twitter terminal
[20:32:34] <robbiet480> idunno
[20:32:34] <robbiet480> why
[20:32:35] <davr> you should come to arduino night and work on it
[20:32:42] <robbiet480> not tonight
[20:32:52] <davr> next time
